                ## PASING THE IMAGE TO THE HTML
                ### SOLUTION 1 - savig uploaded pictures in the uplode folder 
                # making sure the user input is safe to use
                # secure_file_name = secure_filename(image_form.image_file.data.filename)
                # using default file name
                # secure_file_name = "user_default.png"
                # saving the file into a temp file in the system , defined in the Upload folders
                # image_form.image_file.data.save(os.path.join(app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"],secure_file_name))
                # update the src file that gets rendered in the html files
                # image_src = url_for('static', filename=f'uploads/{secure_file_name}') 


                # SOLUTION 2 - passing the image without saving the file on the server
                # recomended bc we dont have to save files on the server
                # Pass Images to HTML Without Saving Them 
                # The file read-write procedure used to transfer images created 
                # in the Python Back-end to the Front-end can sometimes cause problems and run slowly. 
                # In addition, some cloud services do not allow you to write files 
                # to your web applications running on free tier accounts
                #
                # this can be achived we the use of  base64 and io
                # using BytesIO we get the in-memory info to save the image we just read
                # Just like what we do with variables, data can be kept as bytes in an 
                # in-memory buffer when we use the io moduleâ€™s Byte IO operations.
                # We use the in-memory info we get using BytesIO in the save() function inside the PIL library.
                # Finally, we use base64encode to transfer the image we saved as in-memory to html.
