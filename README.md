## 01_Morse_Code_Converter
This is a Python scrypting project - a text-based Morse converter.
Morse code is a way of encoding text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, and named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph.

This programme was developed based on the OOP (object-oriented programming) methodology.
The user will be faced with three options:</br>
- 'encode': after choosing this option, the user will have to provide a text that will be encoded to morse code (the end result),</br>
- 'decode': after choosing this option, the user will have to provide a morse code text that will be decoded (the decoded message will be outputed),</br>
- 'q' - quitting the program.</br>
