# Mastering_Python_through_Projects
This is a repository of professional projects that can be used as ideas to further your Python skills and master this
versatile scripting language. The repository will cover a wide range of projects like scripting Python projects (text-based), Web Development (Flask), Data Science (Pandas, Numpy, SciPy), GUI - graphical user interface (Tkinter), APIs (Requests), Games (Turtle), Web Scrapping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium), Automating Tasks with Python, and many more.


## 01_Morse_Code_Converter
This is a Python scrypting project - a text-based Morse converter.
Morse code is a way of encoding text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, and named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph.
You can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code).</br>
This programme was developed based on the OOP (object-oriented programming) methodology.
The user will be faced with three options:</br>
- 'encode': after choosing this option, the user will have to provide a text that will be encoded to morse code (the end result),</br>
- 'decode': after choosing this option, the user will have to provide a morse code text that will be decoded (the decoded message will be outputed),</br>
- 'q' - quitting the program.</br>
 

## 02_Portfolio_Website_Flask_ready_for_Heroku
This is a one-page Portfolio Website, a unique way to showcase my work and let others know about myself. It is ready to be published and launched on Heroku (https://www.heroku.com/). This way, it can be easily shared via a link with anyone who is interested in my work. The Portfolio Website was developed using the Python framework Flask, CSS, HTML, and Java Script with AJAX (fetch). The styling was done with the help of additional Bootstrap templates (https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer), Bootstrap, and CSS. Additionally, the website is fully mobile responsive with an adaptive navigation bar, and it has a functional, dynamic contact form, which means that after submitting it, it won't reload the entire page. This functionality is achieved by sending a Java Script AJAX request ([fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)) to the Flask server in order to send the data from the form and later validate it on the server side. If successful, the server will send an email that will consist of the data from the contact form. The server will return json data to the website whether or not the process was successful, which will be rendered with JS as a short message below the contact form. In modern browsers, there is no need to use "AJAX" methods like XMLHttpRequest() or jQuery; the modern, built-in JavaScript solution to make these requests from a page is with the use of fetch. All projects listed on the website have a detailed view in a modal that will appear after selecting one of the projects.
